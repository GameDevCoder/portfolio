I have worked in the games industry as an Engineer and a Technical Artist with a focus on pipeline tools and graphics programming.

I like finding efficient ways to optimize work loads, reduce development time and solve the daily problems encountered on game development projects.

I am also very passionate about real-time 3d graphics programming and have a strong interest in DevOps, AI and Machine Learning.

&nbsp;

I studied game development programming at [DigiPen in Vancouver, British Columbia](https://www.digipen.edu/about/our-history){: target="_blank"} for a year. Then, I decided to move overseas to pursue a career as a game developer, continue my studies in game development and gain international experience abroad.

&nbsp;

I have worked on several game projects in the past fifteen years. Presently I am working as a Technical Artist on the Playstation 4 title "[Project Awakening : Arise" at Cygames.](/clients/cygames/){: target="_blank"}

I have also previously worked on console and mobile game titles including [Final Fantasy Grandmasters](/clients/crooz/){: target="_blank"}, [Final Fantasy Agito](/clients/tayutau/){: target="_blank"} and [Demon's Souls](/clients/from-software/){: target="_blank"}.
