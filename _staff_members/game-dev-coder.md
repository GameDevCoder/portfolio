I have worked in the games industry as an Engineer and a Technical Artist with a focus on pipeline tools and graphics programming.

I like finding efficient solutions to solve the complex problems encountered on game development projects.

I also have a strong interest in DevOps, AI and Machine Learning.

I studied game development programming at DigiPen in Vancouver, British Columbia for a year. Then I decided to move overseas to pursue a career as a game developer, continue my studies and gain international experience.

I have worked on several game projects in the past fifteen years. Presently I am working as a Technical Artist on the Playstation 4 title "[Project Awakening : Arise" at Cygames.](/clients/cygames/){: target="_blank"}

I have also previously worked on console and mobile game titles including [Final Fantasy Grandmasters](/clients/crooz/){: target="_blank"}, [Final Fantasy Agito](/clients/tayutau/){: target="_blank"} and [Demon's Souls](/clients/from-software/){: target="_blank"}.
