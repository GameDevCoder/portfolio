### Overview

I worked on art pipeline tools programming for the Playstation 3 title &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Demon's Souls".

I mainly worked on extending the capabilities of a digital asset management system called AlienBrain.

I also worked on improving the Art Pipeline and suggested tools and middleware for the development of the title.

&nbsp;

### Tools Development

#### AlienBrain

AlienBrain is a management and version control system for 2D and 3D art assets. The team working on the Demon's Souls project had many custom created assets they wanted to add to AlienBrain.

I worked on expanding the kinds of assets AlienBrain manages by creating DLLs and added support for custom material and shader files.

#### Art Pipeline Improvement

One of the biggest issues on the art creation side was that it took too long for the artists to check the look of the 3d model assets "in-game" on the Playstation 3.

The process of turning 3d art assets into game assets and loading it up on the game console was tedious work.

After doing information research on several tools and middleware, I suggested using tools from [Gamebryo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamebryo){: target="_blank"}. This provided the art team with a way to preview their 3d art assets on the Playstation 3 much more quickly.
