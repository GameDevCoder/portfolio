# Tayutau

## Employment Overview

From October 1st 2013 to November 1st 2013, I worked as a **Graphics Programmer** at Tayutau in Shinjuku, Tokyo.

I was hired as a "Temp" from an application and game development staffing company.

The company has since changed its name, rebranding itself as "[Amata](https://amata.co.jp/en/works/game-development){: target="_blank"}".

## Mobile Game Project

### Final Fantasy Agito

### Overview

The project was developed with Unity for both iPhone and Android smartphones.

The game featured up close screens of the 2D character faces which were dynamically animated with a middlware plugin from Silicon Studio called &nbsp; &nbsp; [Motion Portrait](https://www.siliconstudio.co.jp/en/products-service/motion-portrait/){: target="_blank"}.

I worked on implementing Motion Portrait in the game for iPhone and Android.

&nbsp;

### Unity Plugin Development

#### MotionPortrait

I developed a plugin for Unity, as well as build the necessary binaries for iPhone and Android. It was not a straight forward process, as custom changes to the Motion Portrait rendering code were needed to get it to work. I submitted support requests to Silicon Studios as needed to solve development issues.
